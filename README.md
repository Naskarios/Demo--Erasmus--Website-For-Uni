# Erasmus Website
The task that was assigned in the university course 'Webapp and webservice design' was about making a completed website (with multiple storages and a database) for students that wanted to register for the Erasmus student program.The website was made using HTML,CSS,Javascript,PHP and for the database we used mysql.


The task was completed succesfully but there is a __considerable amount of 'humour'__ in the site.


**Proceed with caution**
